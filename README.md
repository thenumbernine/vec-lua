# Vector Math Library in Lua

This is slowly getting taken over by my matrix library.

### Dependencies:

- http://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ext
- http://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-parser for building vector classes of arbitrary sizes, and for storing functions as an AST for auto-inlining and Lua optimizations.
